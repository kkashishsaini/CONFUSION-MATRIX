# CONFUSION-MATRIX
PERFORMANCE MATRIX
A confusion matrix is a matrix that summarizes the performance of a machine learning model on a set of test data. 
It is often used to measure the performance of classification models, which aim to predict a categorical label for each input instance.
The matrix displays the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) produced by the model on the test data.
The confusion Matrix gives a comparison between actual and predicted values.
It is used for the optimization of machine learning models.
The confusion matrix is a N x N matrix, where N is the number of classes or outputs.
For 2 classes, we get a 2 x 2 confusion matrix.
For 3 classes, we get a 3 X 3 confusion matrix.
